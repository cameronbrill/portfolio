### Overview

I started drinking tea in 10th grade to cope with my mom's illness. It was a great relief and has served me well.

Through the years between then and now, I went from a casual tea drinker to a connesieur. Over the summer of 2019, I attended multiple classes at The Cultured Cup to learn about different types of teas, their histories, tasting notes, and varieties. Thus began my trip into the expensive hobby that is tea.
