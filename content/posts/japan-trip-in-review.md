# My First Step In Asia

The upright seats. The engine noises. Sweat. Abused arm rests. Rumbling. I landed.

An aisle seat, I peered over Mr. Center and Window to see Tokyo as we passed. Zenzenzense playing in my ears, 5 hours of sleep, it's noon in the Kanto region.

Fast security. Easy customs. Japan is already heaven.

I got my luggage. I search for my friend. Found him.

We get pocket wifi. We get train tickets. I eat my first onigiri. We depart.

## Tokyo 

### nine hours

22 sqaure feet. Bright lights. Colorful lights. Absolute sensory overload.

一蘭. Extra everything. Bliss.

Definition of Shinjuku Station: chaos, ochazuke, and trains.
