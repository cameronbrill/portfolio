# My First Step In Asia

The upright seats. The engine noises. Sweat. Abused arm rests. Rumbling. I landed.

An aisle seat, I peered over Mr. Center and Window to see Tokyo as we passed. Zenzenzense playing in my ears, 5 hours of sleep, it's noon in the Kanto region.

Fast security. Easy customs. Japan is already heaven.

I got my luggage. I search for my friend. Found him.

We get pocket wifi. We get train tickets. I eat my first onigiri. We depart.

## Tokyo 

### nine hours

22 sqaure feet. Bright lights. Colorful lights. Absolute sensory overload.

一蘭. Extra everything. Bliss.

Definition of Shinjuku Station: chaos, ochazuke, and trains.

### Muan

I enter. The lady exclaims "OH! You must be Brad's friend! Here, you can see his signature!" I look. She is very nice.

Osusume. Delicious gastronomy. A view into the local.

Soy sauce ice cream. Creamy with a bite. Number one ice cream.

## Kyoto

### Temple

500 year old buildings, stone roads, freshly groomed rock gardens.

Tatami, futon, shoji.

I am living in history.

### Onsen 

Warm. Nude. Distraught.

Relaxed. Rehealed. Zen.

## Osaka

### Okonomiyaki

Michelin stars. New flavors. Fusion.

### Takoyaki

Fire balls. Complex flavors. Umami.

### Castle

Large. Exciting. Crowded

History. Tourists. Un-unique.

### Aquarium

Abundant animals. Sharks and whales. Controversial.


## Nara

Abundant animals. Deer and humans. Controversial


## Kobe

Chateubriand. Izakaya steak. Tender love.


## Hiroshima

### Okonomiyaki

Noodles. Heavy carbs. Pork. Hearty.

### Tragedy

Many killed. Many remembered. Many depressed.


## Miyajima

Island. Mountain. Boulder. Wasp.


## Tokyo Finale

### Tsukiji

Coffee before sushi. Massive tunas. Sickness.

Board the plane. Land of the free. Sadness.


## Sendai

Walking around aimlessly. Biting our tongues. One day.
