# A Peek Into China

Strict guidelines and organized chaos. Cameras at every corner, overseers watching. Puntual trains prompty arrive.

430km/h. Inches above ground, we sped. Turn the seats, my tire needs leg room. 

## Shanghai

### Holiday Inn

A Holiday Inn accross the way from our room. Minutes from Shanghai Station. Prime location brings us to dinner.

Shanghainese food. Generous parents. My first meal in the forbidden land.


## Hangzhou

### West Lake


## Nanjing

Wild rides. Smoke filled the taxi, report. Run around with sore feet, meet with a friend.

### New Years


## Suzhou
