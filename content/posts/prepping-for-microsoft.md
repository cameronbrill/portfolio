# What am I even working on?
Good question. I'm not 100% sure yet, but it's something to do with telemetry.

# How am I making sure I am as prepared as possible?
I am reading about the technologies I was told I will be using, and am conducting personal experiments with them to familiarize myself with them.

Reaching out to my manager and other interns to better prepare.

# Is this even necessary?
No, but I want to be as good of an intern as I can be.
