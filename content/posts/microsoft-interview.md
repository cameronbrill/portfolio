# I got interviewed

## The interview content

My interview was fairly straightforward. It was a new format: 2 part interview. The first interview was the technical round. During the technical round, I was asked about my projects and how to architect a fullstack application. The second interview was behavioral, based around my experiences in the industry and how I go about solving problems. It was an overall good experience and fairly easy interview.

## I went to eat

### RN94

New American. Fairly average medium-upscale dining experience. Nothing to write home about(ironic).

### Altura 

Italian. 18 courses. Creative, innovative, delicious. Altura is everything that I love about food. Each bite imparted a different emotion. My eyes teared up as I ate everything. I love Altura. This is my new favorite restaurant in the US.
