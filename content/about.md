# Who Am I

I am a Computer Science Honors student at Texas A&M University with a strong interest in large-scale software design and deep learning.

In my freetime, I cook Sichuanese food and ferment things at home (including kombucha). I also love traveling. This [map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c79jtpQB5MpIzMxGQ-aAXcRqmA2pFt3M&usp=sharing) shows all of the places I've visited in my memory.
