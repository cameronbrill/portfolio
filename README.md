my personal website using next.js nested layouts

## developing

### pre-requisite

First, install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### running

Start the typed scss module builder and development server

```
pnpm -s start
```

### tooling
Linters and formatters should be set up for you in VS Code. Otherwise, you can run them manually.

Take a closer look at the scripts in [package.json](./package.json). There are commands for linting, formatting, fixing lint/format errors, and building.

To get started, try linting and formatting the codebase:
```
pnpm -s lint
pnpm -s format
```
